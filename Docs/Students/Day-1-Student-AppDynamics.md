In the Second 3 hours of the lab you will learn the App Dynamics API:
========================================================================
- logon via fly (username and password provided by Instructor)
- Receive a high level power point slide of the Day 1 objectives (1 slide with verbal instruction)
- High Level Overview of: "What is App Dynamics" (provided by Instructor via Power Point - 3 slides with verbal instruction)
- Explanation of Lab Workflow with demo by the Instructor and 1 slide of high level diagram for workflow and the concepts
- Following Demo, Students will repeat steps in Demo to run the App Dynamics Task 1 which will auto-authenticate the student to the
  Thousand Eyes API
- Run a series of API Queries - (provided by Instructor and will be taught using Jupyter Notebook)
- Analyze the JSON returned by the API
- Learn Python techniques to analyze and obtain desired values from API returned JSON output (Instructor provided)
- Students will repeat JSON manipulation steps demo'd by Instructor using Jupyter Notebook
