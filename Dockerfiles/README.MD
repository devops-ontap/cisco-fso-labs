The dockerfiles which are used by the pipeline to build the OCI build containers for the FSO APIs(Intersight, Thousand Eyes, AppDynamics)
are contained in the following external 
repo:
https://github.com/sconrod-tester/docker-builds

The tomcat docker file in this repo is used for the underlying lab infrastructure deployment of the 
tomcat kubernetes deployment that we use for our App Dynamics Java Agent.
